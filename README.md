# 🧠 Cognitive Retraining Program for Children with Disabilities

## SIH 2025 Project

A comprehensive computerized cognitive retraining program that combines EEG neuro-feedback with home-based training for children with developmental disabilities.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Cognitive retraining is a therapeutic strategy that seeks to improve or restore a person's skills in the areas of:
- Paying attention
- Remembering
- Organizing
- Reasoning and understanding
- Problem-solving
- Decision-making
- Higher-level cognitive abilities

Children with Developmental Disability have various cognitive disabilities. Presently many therapists use manual cognitive retraining and it is also difficult to monitor home-based training. Few centers offer EEG Neuro-Feedback Training.

## 💡 Solution

Our solution combines both EEG Neuro-feedback and home training into a single integrated platform where:
- Clinicians can easily monitor changes based on progress in home training
- EEG profile changes are tracked and analyzed
- All data is accessible through a single software interface
- Home-based training becomes more effective and monitored
